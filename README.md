## Business Task

Cyclistic aims to maximize the number of annual memberships.
This analysis focuses on identifying behavioral differences between **casual riders** and **annual members**, and using these insights to develop strategies that convert casual users into members.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

The following steps were performed:

* Combined 12 monthly datasets into a single dataframe
* Converted date columns (`started_at`, `ended_at`) to datetime format
* Created new features:

  * `ride_length` (trip duration in minutes)
  * `day_of_week`
  * `month`
* Removed invalid data:

  * Negative or zero ride durations
  * Outliers (rides longer than 24 hours)

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Key Questions:

* How do ride durations differ between user types?
* How does usage vary by day of week?
* What seasonal trends exist?
* Are there differences in bike type usage?

---

## Key Insights

1. **Casual riders take longer trips than members**
   Casual users tend to use bikes for leisure and exploration.

2. **Members ride more frequently on weekdays**
   This suggests usage for commuting and routine travel.

3. **Casual riders are more active on weekends**
   Their behavior aligns with recreational use.

4. **Strong seasonal trends**
   Usage peaks in warmer months, especially among casual riders.

5. **Slight differences in bike preferences**
   Casual riders show a higher tendency to use electric bikes.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Weekend-focused promotions**
   Offer special weekend membership deals targeting casual riders.

2. **Promote commuting benefits**
   Highlight cost savings and convenience for daily riders.

3. **Seasonal marketing campaigns**
   Focus efforts during spring and summer when usage is highest.

4. **Conversion incentives**
   Provide rewards or discounts for frequent casual riders transitioning to membership.
